## About The Project
Program Analysis aims to build a system that can do more program analysis instead of a simple grading system. Currently, there are a lot of platforms for grading systems but none of them provide features like memory issue checking, error message suggestions and so on features. Also, we plan to impelement an easier way for user to custom their own test cases.

Our current team is made up of backend, frontend and testing subteams. Frontend is in charge of the UI design for submission and login pages. Backend is responsible for the establishment of database and grading. Testing team is responsible for using pytest to test the design. Our semester goal to make a fully functional grading system. Our next step is to try to implement those features to analyze programs.
